## Automatic Config Updater

**Never worry about missing or outdated config options again!**

Whenever the plugin starts, VeinMiner automatically checks your `config.yml` for all important options. If any required option is missing (for example, after an update or if something was accidentally deleted), it will be added back with a safe default value‚Äî**without overwriting your existing settings**.

- Works with all supported and legacy config versions
- Only missing options are added; your customizations remain untouched
- All changes are clearly shown in the server log with prominent warnings and a summary
- Ensures maximum compatibility and prevents plugin errors due to incomplete configs

**Example log output:**
```
[WARNING] [CONFIG UPDATER] Added missing config option: settings.hybrid-mode = false
[WARNING] [CONFIG UPDATER] Added missing config option: settings.hybrid-blacklist with default tree/leaves blocks
[SEVERE] ------------------------------------------------------------
[SEVERE] !!! CONFIG UPDATER: Configuration has been updated !!!
[SEVERE] !!! Missing options have been added with default values. !!!
[SEVERE] !!! Please review your config.yml file for the new settings. !!!
[SEVERE] !!! Check the logs above for details on what was added. !!!
[SEVERE] ------------------------------------------------------------
```
If your config is already complete, you'll see:
```
[INFO] [CONFIG UPDATER] All configuration options are present and up to date.
```

This makes updating and maintaining your server configuration effortless and safe!
